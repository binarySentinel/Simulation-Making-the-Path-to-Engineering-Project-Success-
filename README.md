# Simulation-Making-the-Path-to-Engineering-Project-Success-
âœ¨ Overview: Engineering projects often require expensive and time-consuming physical prototypes to test functionality. But, simulation software like Matlab provides a virtual alternative, allowing us to test and refine our designs without spending less than 1% of the project budget.By simulating each component of a project, as an example from generating AC current to illuminating LEDs, you can identify and address potential issues early on, saving valuable time and resources. So, before investing in a physical prototype, the simulation can definitely pave the way for a successful and cost-effective project. This cost-effective approach ensures project sustainability, resource optimization, and a good reputation.

âœ¨ Simulation Breakdown:
AC Current Generation: Simulated the AC voltage generated by shaking magnets through wire coils.
DC Conversion: Utilized a full bridge rectifier to convert AC to DC, simulating voltage extremes.
DC Current behaviour: Simulated the DC current for capacitor charging.
Capacitor Charging: Modeled capacitor charging based on magnets shaking duration and other parameters.
Capacitor Discharging: Simulated energy discharge to power LEDs, adjusting for bulb configurations.
Why Simulation Matters:
Matlab simulations allowed us to experiment with various scenarios, optimizing the Faraday Flashlight's components without the need for physical prototypes. This approach not only saved time and resources but also ensured a refined, functional design.

ðŸŒŸ Key Achievements:
Developed an accurate Matlab simulation model for the Faraday Flashlight.
Values of components have been optimized for cost-effectiveness, sustainability, and efficiency.
The simulation results were successfully verified against theoretical predictions.
Presented a creative approach to prototyping using simulations.
